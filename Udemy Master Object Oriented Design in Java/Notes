- The main method is the starting point for every Java application
- Memory areas: stack and heap
	- Stack
			- frames are created for the main, and the methods
	- Heap
			- when each object(s) are created
- Garbage Collection: a process that runs in the heap, looks for objects that don't have any relationship, to clear space.

Variables
	- Local Variables: created within method
	- References Variables: referencing variable created outside
	- Instance Variables: belongs to a specific instance
	
Inheritance
	- Parent(Super) and Child(Sub) Class
	
Abstract Class
	- has abstract methods: an abstraction of the idea of something being able to fly
	- can only be extended, not instantiated

Polymorphism
	- allows program to be more dynamic
	
- A class can implement more than one interface

Software Design:
	- Starts with problem statement
	- Think about design (UML).
		- Doesn't need to be complete.
		- Capable of changing and enhancing.
		- Develope Iterativily
		- Keep things simple

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	- A class should only have a single reason to change.
